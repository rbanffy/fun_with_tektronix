# fun_with_tektronix

Tektronix storage tube terminals are the coolest terminals that ever existed. They had no such thing as pixels - they drew on the phosphor screen with an electron beam. 

Storage tubes can be drawn to with a low power beam, in which case the image will have to be frequently redrawn, or with a high power beam, in which case the image will be stored and kept refreshed by the tube itself without the need to redraw it. This gives them their distinctive effect where the line that's being drawn is very bright in relation to the rest of the display and where you can pinpoint where the updates are happening by watching the bright spot.

It also has the unsettling characteristic of building the image by firing a high-power particle gun in your general direction.

I wrote a small program that uses its graphics commands to draw lines on a screen. Unfortunately, I'm not cool enough to have an actual Tektronix 4004 (or one of its even cooler descendants) to play with. I have to content myself with what `xterm` can do.

Sigh.
